/*
 
 If you create your own UIView subclass that is backed by a CAMetalLayer object,
 you must first set the view’s contentScaleFactor property to match the screen’s nativeScale property.
 
 Next, make sure you adjust the size of your render targets whenever your view’s size changes. Finally, adjust the layer’s drawableSize property to match the native screen scale. For an example of how to match the native screen scale, see the MetalBasic3D sample.
